üöÄ Technologies Used
This project is built using the MERN stack, along with modern frontend styling and state management.

Frontend:

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

React Context API: For global state management (authentication).

Backend:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

MongoDB: A NoSQL, document-oriented database.

Mongoose: MongoDB object data modeling (ODM) for Node.js.

bcryptjs: For hashing passwords.

jsonwebtoken: For creating and verifying JWTs for authentication.

dotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.

cors: Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.

Database:

MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-hosted MongoDB service.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js)

MongoDB Atlas Account (for cloud database)

Git

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/hummingbird09/movieMania.git
cd movieMania

2. Backend Setup
Navigate into the backend directory, install dependencies, and set up environment variables.

cd backend
npm install

Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following content:

MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY
PORT=5000

Replace YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string. Make sure to whitelist your IP address in MongoDB Atlas and create a database user.

Replace YOUR_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY with a strong, random string (e.g., generated by openssl rand -base64 32).

Run the backend server:

npm start

The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window, navigate into the frontend directory, install dependencies, and set up environment variables.

cd ../frontend # Go back to root, then into frontend
npm install

Create a .env file in the frontend directory with the following content:

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000

Important: When deploying, you will change http://localhost:5000 to your deployed backend URL (e.g., https://your-backend-app.onrender.com).

Place the background image:

Ensure your desired background image (e.g., image_159ceb.jpg) is placed in the frontend/public/ directory. The index.css is configured to use url('%PUBLIC_URL%/image_159ceb.jpg').

Run the frontend development server:

npm start

The frontend application should now open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.

üöÄ Deployment
This project can be deployed using various platforms. A common setup for MERN stack is:

Backend (Node.js/Express): Render.com (recommended for ease of use and free tier for database/web services)

Frontend (React): Netlify or Vercel (both excellent for static site hosting with CI/CD)

Key steps for deployment:

Update REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL: In your frontend/.env (or set as environment variable in Netlify/Vercel build settings), change REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL to the public URL of your deployed backend.

Backend Environment Variables: Set MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET as environment variables in your backend hosting service (e.g., Render dashboard).

Build Commands:

Frontend: npm run build (publish build directory)

Backend: npm install (build), node server.js (start)
